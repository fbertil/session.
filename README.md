Music Organization App
"session." is a mobile-first productivity app built for music artists and producers to stay organized while working on in-progress tracks. Designed from firsthand experience as an independent artist with over 15 million streams and a peak of 267,000 monthly Spotify listeners, Session addresses a common problem in the music creation process: scattered notes, forgotten mix ideas, and disorganized project versions.

Why session?

Music creators often juggle multiple songs, receive feedback from different sources, and forget small but crucial creative decisions. Voice memos, text threads, and mental notes aren't enough — especially when songs go through several iterations.

Session provides a structured workspace where artists can:

- Upload or link a WIP (Work In Progress) track

- Leave timestamped notes directly tied to moments in the audio

- Categorize ideas using custom tags like “Mixing,” “Arrangement,” or “Vocals”

- Upload multiple versions of a track to track progress and compare changes

The result is a focused, mobile tool that keeps your creative workflow clean and accessible wherever you are.
